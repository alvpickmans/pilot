{"id":"pilot-6ap","title":"BUG: Desktop nav items lack styling - appear as default links","description":"The navigation items in pilot-nav-menu component on desktop view have no styling applied. They appear as default browser links and lists instead of styled navigation items.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open demo.html in a browser\n2. View at desktop width (\u003e 768px)\n3. Observe the navigation items in the pilot-nav-menu\n4. Expected: Styled navigation items with proper typography, spacing, and hover states\n5. Actual: Default browser link styling (blue underlined text, default list bullets)\n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\nThe slotchange event handler _processNavItems() should be adding CSS classes (nav-item, nav-link) to the slotted elements, but this may not be working due to:\n1. Timing issues - slotchange may fire before the component is fully initialized\n2. The re-render issue (same as pilot-hxs) - when render() is called, it may reset the slot content processing\n3. The classes are being added to light DOM elements but the styles are in shadow DOM\n\nSolution:\n1. Fix the re-render issue first (see pilot-hxs)\n2. Ensure _processNavItems runs correctly after initial render\n3. Verify CSS selectors are targeting the right elements\n4. Consider using CSS ::slotted() selector for styling slotted content\n\nNote: The nested dropdown functionality is handled internally by the nav-menu component using _processNavItems and _processMobileNavItems methods with CSS and event handlers.

{"id":"pilot-hxs","title":"BUG: Hamburger button click does not open mobile menu","description":"The hamburger button in pilot-nav-menu component is not functional. When clicked, the mobile menu should open but nothing happens.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open demo.html in a browser\n2. Resize window to mobile width (\u003c 768px) or use mobile view\n3. Click the hamburger menu button\n4. Expected: Mobile menu panel slides in\n5. Actual: Nothing happens\n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\nThe issue is in the attributeChangedCallback method which calls render() for every attribute change. Since render() uses innerHTML to rebuild the entire shadow DOM, it destroys the event listeners attached by _attachEventListeners(). When the component initializes, attributeChangedCallback is triggered, causing a re-render that wipes out the hamburger button click listener.\n\nSolution:\nFollow the pattern used in pilot-toggle component:\n- Only call render() for structural changes (breakpoint, variant, sticky)\n- For the \"open\" attribute, use targeted updates (_openMenu/_closeMenu methods) instead of re-rendering\n- This preserves event listeners and maintains component state\n\nFiles to modify:\n- components/nav-menu.js\n\nPriority: High - Core functionality broken","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"aortegapickmans@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T15:24:46.631418851+01:00","created_by":"Alvaro Ortega Pickmans","updated_at":"2026-01-31T15:26:01.88306806+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"pilot-hxs","depends_on_id":"pilot-6zq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-31T15:24:46.64361255+01:00","created_by":"Alvaro Ortega Pickmans"}]}
