title: Pattern & Texture System
---

- Machine-printed textures: subtle scanlines and microdots
- Dot-matrix patterns and grain textures for surfaces
- Striped patterns for hazard zones; encoded data patterns for UI

Usage rules
- Keep textures low-contrast to preserve legibility
- Use textures to add depth, not reduce readability
