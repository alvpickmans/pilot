Motion guidelines (optional)

- Keep motion minimal and mechanical; if included, use a single axis motion (e.g., a calibration sweep) with restrained duration.
- Provide a static fallback for e‑ink: render the final frame after the transition finishes; ensure essential content is readable without animation.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable or simplify motion for users with reduced motion preferences.
