Desktop Analytics Screen (Textual Mock)

- Header: large display headline with 1–2 digits emphasis; secondary KPI row with 3 lightweight metrics.
- Left panel: 2–3 metric cards stacked; thin dividers between cards.
- Right panel: charts zone with 4 mini bar graphs and a line telemetry graph; numeric readouts aligned in a column using monospace.
- Footer: calibration motif watermark and subtle grid lines.

E‑Ink considerations: ensure font size at least 16px; line height ~1.5 for body, ensure chart lines are at least 2px.
