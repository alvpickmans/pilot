- System Readout Panel (Textual Mock)

- A compact panel showing a set of readouts: status line, numeric meters, and small tick marks along the side.
- Layout uses a 2‑column grid with tight 8px rhythm; labels in monospace; values emphasized with bold display scale.
- Include a small calibration bar at the bottom to reinforce the engineering motif.

E‑Ink considerations: keep border lines strong (2px if needed) and ensure text contrast passes AA on light bg.
