Mobile Dashboard (Textual Mock)

- Layout: 4‑column mobile grid at 8px rhythm; safe zone 16px.
- Header: strong display heading; right aligned status crosshair metric.
- Cards: metric cards with thin borders; 2–3 per screen depending on viewport; vertical stack with 8px gaps.
- Telemetry line: 1px line graph with bold data line; axis labels in monospace.
- Chips: small label blocks using the monospace font; alignment ticks at left.

E‑Ink considerations: keep contrast high; avoid tiny text; use 14px body with 1.6 leading.
