- Marketing Landing Hero (Textual Mock)

- Layout: strong left‑aligned hero with a large number in the display scale; supportive subheading in monospace as technical annotation.
- Right: calibration motif panel with a few key bullets and a call to action.
- Visuals: subtle scanline texture in background; borders are hairline; use blank white space for breathing room.

E‑Ink considerations: prioritize hierarchy via typography scale and bold numbers; avoid heavy color use.
