Iconography style guide

Principles
- Monochrome only, 1–2 px strokes.
- Align to grid; use 1 px stroke for most icons; 2 px for emphasis icons.
- Crosshairs, dotted lines, scanlines, ticks, and modular geometry in engineering style.

Stroke weights
- Primary stroke: 1px
- Accent/important: 2px (used sparingly)

Corner rules
- Corners: 90° squared by default; use subtle rounding only if necessary for legibility on small icons.
- Avoid extremely sharp intersections that lose legibility on e‑ink.

Export guidance
- Export as SVG with viewBox kept; keep strokes sharp on 1–2 px lines.
- Ensure icons scale down cleanly to 12–16 px for UI chips or 24–32 px for headers.
