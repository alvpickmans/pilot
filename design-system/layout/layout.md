Layout System
=============

Modular Grid
- Base unit: 8 px; grid: 12 columns on desktop; adapt to 6 columns on smaller viewports
- Gutters: 16 px (desktop); 12 px (tablet); 8 px (mobile)
- Container width: 1120 px max; content should respect the 8 px grid
- Breakpoints: xs 0px, sm 640px, md 768px, lg 1024px, xl 1280px

Aspect Ratios
- Cards and panels: standard aspect ratios of 4:3 or 16:9 for diagrams
- Maintain consistent ratios in diagrams and watermark sections

Composition Patterns
- Label Blocks: left-aligned label column with dense numeric IDs; right block for description
- Technical Cards: header with monospace ID, body with data grid, actions at bottom
- Badge Areas: right-aligned status badges with a thin border

Dividers and Separators
- Line-based separators: 2 px solid line in neutral 4
- Dividers act as visual hierarchy markers between blocks

Spacing Rules
- Consistent padding: 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 px scale
- Group related blocks within a padded container; maintain 8 px rhythm across pages
