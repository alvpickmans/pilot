Brand Identity: Industrial-Government Tone
-----------------------------------------

Concept and Narrative
- A brand language built for laboratories, industrial facilities, and government-adjacent institutions.
- Signals precision, compliance, and traceability. Visuals read as machine-printed, retro-technical, and audit-ready.
- Tone: formal, disciplined, and confident; values clarity, legibility, and recognizability over ornament.

Logo System
- Primary logo: a square, grid-aligned emblem with bold stroke, used on official documents and signage.
- Secondary logo: a compact wordmark with monospaced glyph spacing; suitable for headers, stamps, and UI headers.
- Mark-only: an emblem that can sit alone on seals, badges, and device labels.
- All marks are grayscale; when color is required for accessibility, use the accent color as a system-wide highlight.

Construction Rules and Grid
- Base grid: 8 px. All elements align to this baseline for consistency.
- Layout grid: 12-column grid with 8 px gutters on desktop; scalable via tokens for tablet/mobile.
- Clear space: maintain at least 1.5x the cap height of the logo around the mark; avoid placing text or graphics in that zone.
- Minimum sizes: primary logo width 40 px on UI surfaces; logo mark 20 px minimum for stamps.
- Geometry: rounded rectangles, right angles, and straight lines dominate; avoid organic curves.

Variations (Labels, Seals, Badges, Stamps)
- Labels: compact rectangles with bold prefixes (e.g., U-01-002) and a line of metadata.
- Seals/Stamps: circular or oval seals with a striped wheel motif and an outer ring with microtext indications.
- Badges: rounded rectangles with border accents to indicate status (OK, WARN, STOP).
- All variations should use the same stroke weight, corner radii, and grid scale for consistency.

Notes on Accessibility and Usage
- Ensure sufficient contrast against backgrounds; if needed, apply the neutral palette with the darkest neutral for logo marks.
- Use the primary logo on light surfaces; on dark surfaces, invert to white where possible.
- For accessibility checks, avoid stacking logo elements behind busy textures.
