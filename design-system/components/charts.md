Charts & data visuals

Visual language: simple, legible, monochrome with minimal color accents. Micro‑charts render in a compact 8px rhythm grid.

Bar mini‑graphs
- Horizontal bars with 1px outline; use tone0 for bars on white; fill only for emphasis.
- Each bar aligns to baseline grid; spacing 4px between bars.

Line telemetry graphs
- Fixed‑width canvas or SVG; 1px strokes; use tone1 for grid lines and tone0 for the data line.
- Points at data intersections can be round 2px markers if needed.

Numeric readouts
- Monospace font for alignment; use h1-like scale for big numbers; units in secondary text below.

E‑Ink mode variations
- Graph lines are solid, high‑contrast tone0; avoid gradients; use tone0 for major lines and tone1 for minor grid lines.
- Ensure the data line thickness is at least 2px for readability.
