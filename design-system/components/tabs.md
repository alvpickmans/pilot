Tabs — Monospaced, utilitarian

Visual: A horizontal tab bar using the monospace secondary type. Each tab is a small label with a thin bottom rule to indicate active state.

States
- Default: inactive tab shows muted gray text; active tab shows primary color with a bold weight.
- Hover: underline/wave emphasis; in e‑ink, highlight the active tab with stronger contrast.
- Active: bottom hairline in primary color; text color primary; background surface remains white.
- Disabled: gray muted; underline removed.

E‑Ink mode variation
- Use solid bottom border in a tone0 (black) for active tab; inactive tabs mute with tone1 gray.

Layout notes
- Use a baseline grid of 8px; tab height about 32px on desktop; scale down for mobile.
- Spacing: 12px horizontal padding per tab; 8px gap between tabs.
