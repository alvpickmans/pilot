Dividers — Hairline rules

Visual: Hairline 1px dividers used to separate sections and components. Monochrome; scale thickness sparingly.

Rules
- Use hairline dividers to define boundaries between panels, cards, and rows.
- Spacing around dividers: 8px–12px of vertical space for readability.
- In e‑ink mode, ensure the divider has a solid tone (tone0 or tone1) for legibility against light backgrounds.

Examples
- Between metric rows in a dashboard
- Separating header and content blocks on a marketing hero grid
