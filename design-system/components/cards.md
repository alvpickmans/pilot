Card — Metric‑focused, thin rules

Visual: A panel with a thin 1px border on white or gray backgrounds. Metrics are the primary content; supporting text is secondary with smaller typography.

States
- Default: thin border, light background; primary metric highlighted with a larger font size or bolder weight.
- Hover (desktop only): a subtle shadow or lift effect (avoid heavy shadows for e‑ink).
- Active: the card is highlighted with subtle fill; border remains visible.
- Disabled: desaturated colors; reduced contrast.

E‑Ink mode variation
- Use a solid light gray fill with a bold, high‑contrast metric number in tone0 for readability.

Layout notes
- Grid: 8px rhythm; card padding 12px–16px; inner metric sits on its own line with a clear typographic hierarchy.
- Content order: metric (primary) first, label/units second. Include a small caption if needed.
