Calibration panel motifs

Visual: Panels and readouts that resemble calibration interfaces (e.g., calibration marks, rulers, crosshairs). Emphasize precision and measurement cues.

Elements
- Grids and crosshairs: thin lines at regular intervals (8px baseline) with tick marks at major intervals.
- Calibration marks: small square/triangle ticks along edges to imply alignment checks.
- Meters: simple numeric readouts with a thin baseline; use monospace for values.

E‑Ink mode variation
- Use stronger tick marks (tone0) and bolder crosshair lines for legibility.
- Avoid very fine lines; scale to at least 2px where possible on e‑ink.
